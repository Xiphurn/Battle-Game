# Battle-Game

This repository contains a simple text-based battle game implemented in Python. The player faces off against an NPC (Non-Player Character) and can choose between attacking the enemy or taking a potion to restore health. The game continues until either the player or the NPC runs out of health points.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

## Usage
To play the game, run the " battle_game.py " script :

During each turn, you will be prompted to either attack the enemy or take a potion:


" Do you want to attack (1) or take a potion (2)? "


Enter 1 to attack the enemy or 2 to take a potion. The game will display the outcome of each turn, showing the damage dealt and the remaining health points for both the player and the enemy.

The game ends when either the player's or the enemy's health points reach zero. The final outcome (win/lose) will be displayed, and the game will automatically close after 60 seconds.
